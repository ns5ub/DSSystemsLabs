# Option 3: Discord Bot
Deliverable: Create and publish an interactive Discord bot in a test server (provided for you by the instructor). Unlike a Twitter bot that simply parses and replies to messages sent to it, Discord bots can have much more functionality. For instance, they can have a wide variety of commands that users can invoke in channels as well as in direct messages with the bot.
Like a Twitter bot, a Discord bot must be backed by a Python-backed application that runs actively with an open connection to the Discord activity API and is invoked by bot commands and messages. You must write and publish this app, and it should connect to at least one external data source such as an external API or a database for some of its possible interactions.
Your bot does not have to be "serious" – for instance it could play a game or quiz, but the seriousness will be found in how your application handles data, performs remote retrieval and processing of requests and replies.

Benchmarks:
1. Your bot should recognize a "help" message and reply with user instructions.
2. Your bot should provide at least three commands or functions.
3. Your bot should reply promptly with an intelligent response or an informative error
message.
4. Your bot should integrate with at least one external data source that you can document
and describe. This could be a database system or API.
5. Submit all code in a standalone GitHub repository in your account.
